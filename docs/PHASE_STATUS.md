# Nisfi — Phase Status and Resume Record

## Official resume rule

This file is the official record for resuming work, alongside `NISFI_MASTER_SPEC.md`, `docs/DECISIONS.md`, the actual repository state, and the owner's newest instruction. A unit may move forward only after explicit owner approval; silence is not approval.

## Current position

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Current phase | Phase 0 — Product foundation and approved design language |
| Current unit | Unit 0.2 — next-intl locale routing and semantic RTL/LTR base with a minimal route shell |
| Implementation state | Implemented and verified; delivered to `main` and `claude/project-review-a9s1w1` |
| Delivery note | Owner directed that all work land on `main`; each completed unit is fast-forwarded to `main`. |
| Previous units | Unit 0.0 (docs) — closed and owner-approved 2026-07-20. Unit 0.1 (monorepo scaffold) — delivered to `main`. |
| Reference | `NISFI_MASTER_SPEC.md`, Sections 4, 5, 9, 13, and 16 |

## Unit 0.2 objective

Add next-intl locale routing over the scaffold: the URL prefix is always present (`/ar`, `/en`, `/tr`) with Arabic as the default, `dir="rtl"` for Arabic and `dir="ltr"` otherwise, self-hosted fonts, and a minimal, fully localized route shell with working locale switching. No product features, auth, Firebase, Tailwind, or design system are introduced.

## Implemented scope

- Installed Next.js 16.2.10 (App Router, Turbopack), React 19.2.7, and next-intl 4.13.2 into `apps/web`, pinned exactly.
- Added next-intl routing (`src/i18n/routing.ts`) reusing the shared `Locale` model (`ar` default, `localePrefix: "always"`), request config (`src/i18n/request.ts`), and locale-aware navigation (`src/i18n/navigation.ts`).
- Added `src/proxy.ts` (Next.js 16's renamed middleware) running the next-intl middleware for locale normalization.
- Added the `[locale]` route group: root layout sets `<html lang dir>` semantically, self-hosts IBM Plex Sans Arabic (Arabic) and Inter (Latin) via `next/font`, and wraps content in `NextIntlClientProvider`.
- Added a minimal, fully localized landing shell and a `LocaleSwitcher` client component; all copy lives in `messages/{ar,en,tr}.json` with no hardcoded UI strings.
- Added typed message augmentation (`src/global.d.ts`) so translation keys are checked.
- Extended tooling: Next-compatible strict `tsconfig`, `@next/eslint-plugin-next` rules for `apps/web`, and `.next`/`next-env.d.ts` ignored by ESLint/Prettier/git.

## Files created or changed by Unit 0.2

| File / directory | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `apps/web/next.config.ts` | Next config wrapped with the next-intl plugin. |
| `apps/web/tsconfig.json` | Next-compatible strict TypeScript config. |
| `apps/web/src/i18n/{routing,request,navigation}.ts` | next-intl routing, request config, navigation primitives. |
| `apps/web/src/proxy.ts` | Locale middleware (Next 16 `proxy`). |
| `apps/web/src/app/[locale]/{layout,page}.tsx` | Localized root layout (RTL/LTR, fonts) and landing shell. |
| `apps/web/src/app/globals.css` | Minimal RTL-aware base styles using logical properties. |
| `apps/web/src/components/locale-switcher.tsx` | Locale switcher. |
| `apps/web/src/global.d.ts` | Typed locale/messages augmentation. |
| `apps/web/messages/{ar,en,tr}.json` | Localized copy (single source for UI strings). |
| `eslint.config.mjs`, `.gitignore`, `.prettierignore` | Next plugin + ignore Next build artifacts. |

## Explicitly not implemented

- No Tailwind, shadcn/ui, design tokens, or design system (Units 0.3–0.4).
- No authentication, session guards, Firebase SDK, or App Check (Units 0.5 and 1.x).
- No `no-restricted-imports` Firebase boundary lint rule (Unit 0.5).
- No product routes beyond the landing shell, no data model, no Cloud Functions handlers.
- No secrets, project IDs, or deployment configuration.

## Verification evidence

| Check | Evidence |
|---|---|
| Runtime policy | Node `v22.22.2`, pnpm `11.15.1` |
| Production build | `next build` succeeds; `/ar`, `/en`, `/tr` prerendered (SSG); proxy detected |
| Root redirect | `GET /` → `307` to `/ar` (default locale) |
| RTL/LTR | `/ar` → `<html lang="ar" dir="rtl">`; `/en` and `/tr` → `dir="ltr"` |
| Localization | Arabic/English/Turkish copy rendered from message catalogs; no hardcoded UI strings |
| Locale switching | Switcher links to `/ar`, `/en`, `/tr`; active locale marked `aria-current` |
| Aggregate gate | `pnpm check` passes: typecheck, lint, format, and 5 tests across 3 packages |

## Next proposed unit — do not execute without approval

**Phase 0 / Unit 0.3: two high-fidelity visual directions** using real Nisfi content on landing/member/admin sample surfaces, for the owner to select or combine.

This unit requires an owner decision (D-001: approved visual direction). It is the next proposed unit only and needs explicit owner direction before it begins; no generic template is acceptable. Unit 0.5 additionally depends on owner-provided Firebase project IDs and credentials (D-002).
